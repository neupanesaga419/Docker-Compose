sudo bash

change user in terminal from root to normal user

su -l user

change user permissions to  all user 

o - Everyone
u - user
g - group

r - read 
w - write 
x - execute

chmod o+w <file or dir name> to give permissions to write files

If we want to give permissions to files and folders inside the directory and 777 means all permissions
sudo chmod -R 777 <dirname>
